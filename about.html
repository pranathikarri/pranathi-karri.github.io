  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I am a dedicated Data Science professional with a strong academic background
    and practical experience in data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning.
    I specialize in transforming complex datasets into meaningful insights that
    support data-driven decision-making.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a final-year B.Tech student in Computer Science & Engineering (Data Science),
    I have developed a solid understanding of the complete data lifecycle — from
    data collection and preprocessing to model development, evaluation, and deployment.

  <p>
    Through internships and hands-on projects, I have worked with real-world datasets,
    built predictive models, created interactive dashboards, and implemented
    privacy-preserving AI solutions. I am highly motivated, detail-oriented,
    and continuously learning to stay aligned with industry standards.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am actively seeking freelance, internship, and entry-level roles where I can
    contribute my analytical skills, technical expertise, and problem-solving abilities
    to impactful projects.
