  <div style="max-width:900px;margin:0 auto;font-size:18px;line-height:1.8;color:#cbd5f5;">

    <p>
      I am a dedicated Data Science professional with a strong academic background
      and practical experience in data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning.
      I specialize in transforming complex datasets into meaningful insights that
      support data-driven decision-making.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a final-year B.Tech student in Computer Science & Engineering (Data Science),
      I have developed a solid understanding of the complete data lifecycle — from
      data collection and preprocessing to model development, evaluation, and deployment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through internships and hands-on projects, I have worked with real-world datasets,
      built predictive models, created interactive dashboards, and implemented
      privacy-preserving AI solutions. I am highly motivated, detail-oriented, and
      continuously learning to stay aligned with industry standards.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am actively seeking freelance, internship, and entry-level roles where I can
      contribute my analytical skills, technical expertise, and problem-solving abilities
      to impactful projects.
    </p>
